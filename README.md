# Unit 12: SQL - Employee Tracker

In this assignment, I created a command line application which is meant to help keep track of employees. This application will display a table for each of the database tables, employees, roles, and departments. Each role has a department associate with it, and each Employee has a role, department, and manager associated with it. If there is no manager, the manager column will show up as "N/A". In this application, you can also choose to add an employee, role, or department. This application is run by the inquirer package to ask questions with a postgres database. Each of the add methods have dynamic lists for the choices that require references.
I did reference a github repository that resembles this project in order to get some insight on the queries I needed for manipulating the database. That repository is linked below.
